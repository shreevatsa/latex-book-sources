# LaTeX sources (by Nityanand Misra) of books in Indic scripts

Here is the LaTeX source code that went into the creation of these books in Devanagari, beautifully typeset by Nityanand Misra:

*   _Mahāvīrī: Hanumān-Cālīsā Demystified_

    Hindi commentary by Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya on the Hanumān-Cālīsā

    (Fourth edition, summer 2021. In the directory `Mahaviri/`)

*   _Śrībhaktamāla (Mūlārthabodhinī Ṭīkā Sahita)_

    Mūlārthabodhinī: A Hindi commentary on the Bhaktamāla of Gosvāmī Nābhādāsa, by Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya

    (Second edition, January 2021. Currently in [another repository](https://github.com/shreevatsa/xelatex-Mularthabodhini).)

*   _Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe’pāṇinīyaprayogāṇāṃ Vimarśaḥ_

    _Deliberation on non-Pāṇinian usages in the Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa_ by Ācārya Giridharalāla Miśra Prajñācakṣu, known in his current Āśrama as Jagadguru Rāmanandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya

    (Typeset in 2016. Currently in [another repository](https://github.com/shreevatsa/nmisra-arapv).)

I have uploaded these source files (shared by Nityanand Misra) here because of my interest in TeX/LaTeX/typesetting, and because these examples, each of a complete book in the Devanagari script, typeset with TeX-related technology, may be useful to anyone else attempting to typeset books in Indian languages.
